They show that Frames can also be used to study memory in dialogue management and information presentation through natural language generation. They also provide a baseline model for frame tracking task"	Frames; Memory; Goal Oriented Dialogue; NLG; IOB; Frame Tracking	2016A Critical Review of Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence Learning	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.00019.pdf	Deep Learning	"This paper provide a detailed explanation on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and its state of the art variants : Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN). Authors have syntesized the body of research over the past three decades that has yielded these powerful models. Some intersesting conclusions are : <ul><li> Many advances come from novel architectures rather than fundamentally novel algorithms</li><li>Extension of RNNs to longer form text in Natural language tasks will be fruitful.</li> <li>Dialogue systems could be built along similar principles to the architectures used for translation, encoding prompts and generating responses, retaining the entirety of conversation history as contextual information.</li></ul>"	"Recurrent Neural Networks, Sequence Learning"	2015
